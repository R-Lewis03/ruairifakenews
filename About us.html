<h1>About us</h1>
<p>This website is about fake news. Fake news is news or stories on the internet that are not true and it is a issue that is still going on at the moment. There are two types of fake news, the first point is that false stories that are deliberately publishedor sent around, in order to make people believe something untrue or to get lots of people to visit a website. These are deliberate lies that are put online, even though the person writing them knows that they are made up. The second point is that stories that may have some truth to them, but they're not completely accurate. This is because the people writing them - for example, journalists or bloggers - don't check all of the facts before publishing the story, or they might exaggerate some of it.It is happening a lot at the moment, with many people publishing these stories in order to get as many shares as possible.It's a problem because The first kind of fake news - deliberate lies - is a problem because it can make people believe things that are completely untrue.Also The second kind - when people publish something without checking that it's completely right - can make people have less trust in the media, as well as make everyone believe something that might be inaccurate.
